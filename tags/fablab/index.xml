      <title>Breathney: A modular design toolbox for an affordable ventilator with full functionality</title>
      <link>https://mrunacre.github.io/post/fablab/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic is still progressing globally and a small but significant
fraction of patients need mechanical ventilation at some point. Although some
countries have sufficient ventilators, there are indications of a future global
shortage of such devices. Medtronic released documents for their ventilator,
showing a global urgent need. Rapidly prototyped, industrially manufactured
ventilators can help alleviate this shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With crucial support from UZ Brussels , Flanders Make, Audi and other partners,
a team of 40 students, alumni, staff and external experts
at the Fablab Brussels have recently designed and prototyped
a ventilator
that has been produced industrially and is currently being tested extensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We intend to contribute to the
world-wide ventilator effort in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the scientific experiments to investigate and iteratively increase the
level of compliance with published requirements (e.g.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tinyurl.com/wfqtk4w&#34;&gt;https://tinyurl.com/wfqtk4w&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate that a fully functional ventilator can be mass-produced (&amp;gt;100
units daily for a mid-sized facility in e.g. automotive sector) with
minimal pressure on the medical supply chain, by maximally sourcing components
from non-medical sectors, at a well-documented unit cost that is affordable
compared to conventional ventilators (without being low-cost per se)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make available a toolbox for all aspects of ventilator system (mechanical,
electrical, sensors, control, interface). The different aspects are designed
in a modular manner so that e.g. the control unit can be used with both
pump-based and pneumatic approaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the design open-source. Share the design and documentation. Assist other
groups worldwide in adapting design and setting up local production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Interaction of closely-spaced vertical-axis wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://mrunacre.github.io/project/vawt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vertical-axis wind turbines, when placed close together, have an improved power
production and very interesting aerodynamics. The experimental side of this
project is the PhD project of Antoine Vergaerde. The computational side of the
project is taken care of by Greeshma Boohalli Shivamallegowda.
Both Antoine and Greeshma are supervised by

&lt;a href=&#34;https://flow.research.vub.be/en/tim-de-troyer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tim De Troyer&lt;/a&gt; and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the viability of vertical-axis wind turbines for the production of
electricity is still open for debate, they may have certain niche applications,
and definitely have very interesting aerodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built our own set of scales models, shown above during a wind tunnel test run
at PoliMi in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Feasibility and performance assessment of small and medium-sized wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/smwt_jochem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is considerable uncertainty about the role that small and medium wind
turbines may play in the production of sustainable electricity. In the present
work, we identify the main factors affecting the economic viability of small and
medium wind turbines (herafter SMWTs). We then propose a framework for more
efficient and reliable predictions of the annual energy production of SMWTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We
demonstrate that these turbines are indeed profitable, provided that an
appropriate turbine is selected and that the annual energy production is
estimated carefully. These seemingly simple tasks are non-trivial and current
practices too often lead to unreliable assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first assemble a database of wind turbines with a rated power up to 100 kW.
Such a database is a necessary tool when assessing the feasibility of a project
involving SMWTs, since the market is very immature, with a wide variation in
quality between different turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then calculate the annual energy production (AEP) for a number of measurement
sites in Belgium and The Netherlands and for different independently-tested
SMWTs. Based on these data and on first principles, we show what the best
methods are to select an appropriate turbine and what the expected accuracy is
of the AEP estimate.
We have found that a particular statistical error has been overlooked in the
current methods to estimate the annual energy production. This error is the
possible mismatch of the averaging times with which wind speeds and turbine
power outputs are sampled. Using wind speed and power measurements, we show how
this error can be minimised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings have an immediate practical importance. We therefore apply our
methods in a number of case studies, and give recommendations for future SMWT
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
