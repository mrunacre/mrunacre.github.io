      <title>High-fidelity surrogate wind data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to create a modelling framework for
high-fidelity surrogate wind data. This work is largely the PhD project of
Daniele D&amp;rsquo;Ambrosio whom I supervise with prof.Â 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://flow.research.vub.be/en/tim-de-troyer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tim De Troyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing sophistication of wind turbine design and control generates a
need for high-quality data. Therefore, the relatively limited set of measured
wind data needs to be extended with computer-generated surrogate data, e.g. to
make reliable statistical studies of energy production and mechanical loads.
Surrogate data should realistically reflect the full scale of possible wind
conditions. First, the surrogate data should conform to the same statistical
descriptors as measured physical data (in particular the amplitude distribution
and the frequency spectrum).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are methods that can handle this. A much
bigger challenge is non-stationarity, reflected by the variation of wind
conditions on distinct temporal scales (such as daily or seasonal variations).
No existing method can fully capture this non-stationarity. Furthermore, wind
data are three-dimensional, in the sense that information about the wind
direction is as important as information about the wind speed. In this
application, we outline a unified mathematical framework to tackle the twin
challenges of non-stationarity and three- dimensionality. The framework allows
to generate non-stationary, three-dimensional wind time series with high
fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a framework is generic and can be used to generate surrogate data for other
non-stationary processes, such as ocean waves or pollutant dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preprint of a paper outline the approach is available through 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07218&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
