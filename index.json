This work is largely the PhD project of Daniele D\u0026rsquo;Ambrosio whom I supervise with prof. Tim De Troyer.\nThe increasing sophistication of wind turbine design and control generates a need for high-quality data. Therefore, the relatively limited set of measured wind data needs to be extended with computer-generated surrogate data, e.g. to make reliable statistical studies of energy production and mechanical loads. Surrogate data should realistically reflect the full scale of possible wind conditions. First, the surrogate data should conform to the same statistical descriptors as measured physical data (in particular the amplitude distribution and the frequency spectrum). There are methods that can handle this. A far bigger challenge is non-stationarity, reflected by the variation of wind conditions on distinct temporal scales (such as daily or seasonal variations). No existing method can fully capture this non-stationarity. Furthermore, wind data are three-dimensional, in the sense that information about the wind direction is as important as information about the wind speed. In this application, we outline a unified mathematical framework to tackle the twin challenges of non-stationarity and three- dimensionality. The framework allows to generate non-stationary, three-dimensional wind time series with high fidelity.\nSuch a framework is generic and can be used to generate surrogate data for other non-stationary processes, such as ocean waves or pollutant dispersion.\nA preprint of a paper outline the approach is available through arXiv.\n","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586616634,"objectID":"ee95961f567be9fd288d66d145c209c8","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/project/surrogate_data/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/surrogate_data/","section":"project","summary":"The objective of this project is to create a modelling framework for high-fidelity surrogate wind data.

Although some countries have sufficient ventilators, there are indications of a future global shortage of such devices. Medtronic released documents for their ventilator, showing a global urgent need. Rapidly prototyped, industrially manufactured ventilators can help alleviate this shortage.\nWith crucial support from UZ Brussels , Flanders Make, Audi and other partners, a team of 40 students, alumni, staff and external experts at the Fablab Brussels have recently designed and prototyped a ventilator that has been produced industrially and is currently being tested extensively.\nWe intend to contribute to the world-wide ventilator effort in the following way:\n Perform the scientific experiments to investigate and iteratively increase the level of compliance with published requirements (e.g. https://tinyurl.com/wfqtk4w) Demonstrate that a fully functional ventilator can be mass-produced (\u0026gt;100 units daily for a mid-sized facility in e.g. automotive sector) with minimal pressure on the medical supply chain, by maximally sourcing components from non-medical sectors, at a well-documented unit cost that is affordable compared to conventional ventilators (without being low-cost per se) Make available a toolbox for all aspects of ventilator system (mechanical, electrical, sensors, control, interface). The different aspects are designed in a modular manner so that e.g. the control unit can be used with both pump-based and pneumatic approaches Make the design open-source.

This renewed interest has led to an increasing number of experimental studies on VAWTs. A challenge of experimental work is correctly interpreting experimental results but just as important is the design of the experimental setup.\nThe objective of the present study is to elaborate on the complete development process of a VAWT wind tunnel test setup, from design to aerodynamic interpretation. The effect of the design choices and structural characteristics of the setup can be traced in the measured torque. The influence of structural dynamics of an experimental setup are proven to influence unsteady measurements significantly through the analysis of the spectral content of the measured torque. An extensive modal analysis of the VAWT rotor allows to link modal vibrations to their contaminating effect on the measured torque. In addition, the dynamics of the sensors and setup are found to be important contributions to the contamination of dynamic measurements. To interpret unsteady torque measurements, the complete experimental setup needs to be dynamically characterised.\n","date":1586469600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586675298,"objectID":"13acb9c194cfe649d1af0ebcbd759ab1","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/vawt_design/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vawt_design/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes the design, manufacturing and validation of a vertical-axis wind turbine setup for wind tunnel tests.\n","tags":["VAWT","fablab"],"title":"Design and manufacturing of a VAWT scale model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Vertical-axis wind turbines, when placed close together, have an improved power production and very interesting aerodynamics.

In the present work, we identify the main factors affecting the economic viability of small and medium wind turbines (herafter SMWTs). We then propose a framework for more efficient and reliable predictions of the annual energy production of SMWTs.\nWe demonstrate that these turbines are indeed profitable, provided that an appropriate turbine is selected and that the annual energy production is estimated carefully. These seemingly simple tasks are non-trivial and current practices too often lead to unreliable assessments.\nWe first assemble a database of wind turbines with a rated power up to 100 kW. Such a database is a necessary tool when assessing the feasibility of a project involving SMWTs, since the market is very immature, with a wide variation in quality between different turbines.\nWe then calculate the annual energy production (AEP) for a number of measurement sites in Belgium and The Netherlands and for different independently-tested SMWTs. Based on these data and on first principles, we show what the best methods are to select an appropriate turbine and what the expected accuracy is of the AEP estimate. We have found that a particular statistical error has been overlooked in the current methods to estimate the annual energy production. This error is the possible mismatch of the averaging times with which wind speeds and turbine power outputs are sampled. Using wind speed and power measurements, we show how this error can be minimised.\nOur findings have an immediate practical importance. We therefore apply our methods in a number of case studies, and give recommendations for future SMWT projects.\n","date":1428616800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586673357,"objectID":"1caf086f6b9047d931e6ae58313b6752","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/smwt_jochem/","publishdate":"2015-04-10T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/smwt_jochem/","section":"publication","summary":"There is considerable uncertainty about the role that small and medium wind turbines may play in the production of sustainable electricity.
