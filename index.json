This work is largely the PhD project of Daniele D\u0026rsquo;Ambrosio whom I supervise with prof. Tim De Troyer.\nThe increasing sophistication of wind turbine design and control generates a need for high-quality data. Therefore, the relatively limited set of measured wind data needs to be extended with computer-generated surrogate data, e.g. to make reliable statistical studies of energy production and mechanical loads. Surrogate data should realistically reflect the full scale of possible wind conditions. First, the surrogate data should conform to the same statistical descriptors as measured physical data (in particular the amplitude distribution and the frequency spectrum).\nThere are methods that can handle this. A much bigger challenge is non-stationarity, reflected by the variation of wind conditions on distinct temporal scales (such as daily or seasonal variations). No existing method can fully capture this non-stationarity. Furthermore, wind data are three-dimensional, in the sense that information about the wind direction is as important as information about the wind speed. In this application, we outline a unified mathematical framework to tackle the twin challenges of non-stationarity and three- dimensionality. The framework allows to generate non-stationary, three-dimensional wind time series with high fidelity.\nSuch a framework is generic and can be used to generate surrogate data for other non-stationary processes, such as ocean waves or pollutant dispersion.\nA preprint of a paper outline the approach is available through arXiv.\n","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586886447,"objectID":"ee95961f567be9fd288d66d145c209c8","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/project/surrogate_data/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/surrogate_data/","section":"project","summary":"The objective of this project is to create a modelling framework for high-fidelity surrogate wind data.

In that context, photovoltaic (PV) panels have proven to be an effective solution. Meanwhile, the market of small wind turbines is increasing, and some building owners have already installed one or more units on their roof. While the economic comparison between PV panels and wind turbines has already largely been addressed, in general, the space constraint of a rooftop has never been taken into account. In this work, the authors propose a methodology to compare the energy production and the return on investment both for rooftop-mounted PV panels and wind turbines. The comparison is made for relatively tall buildings (≥60 m) with good wind conditions (≥5 m/s annual mean wind speed). Using a brute-force approach, this study presents the results of the methodology applied to a case study: the Brussels Region. On tall rooftops, considering the space already taken by other installations and assuming an average wind speed of 5 m/s, small building-mounted wind turbines are shown to produce more energy than PV panels. Nevertheless, their return on investment is always lower than that of the PV panels.","tags":null,"title":"Techno-economic comparison of rooftop-mounted PVs and small wind turbines: a case study for Brussels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Vergaerde","Tim De Troyer","Andreu Carbo Molina","Lieven Standaert","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"1aa0647afa2d6c7946dac41c7182f3fa","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/e-0-d-6-b-2074-e-83445-a-89-f-8-d-497297-bdafa/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.032229Z","relpermalink":"/publication/e-0-d-6-b-2074-e-83445-a-89-f-8-d-497297-bdafa/","section":"publication","summary":"The potential of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) for specific applications (floating off-shore or urban installations) has been reconsidered in recent years.

The objective of the present study is to elaborate on the complete development process of a VAWT wind tunnel test setup, from design to aerodynamic interpretation. The effect of the design choices and structural characteristics of the setup can be traced in the measured torque. The influence of structural dynamics of an experimental setup are proven to influence unsteady measurements significantly through the analysis of the spectral content of the measured torque. An extensive modal analysis of the VAWT rotor allows to link modal vibrations to their contaminating effect on the measured torque. In addition, the dynamics of the sensors and setup are found to be important contributions to the contamination of dynamic measurements. To interpret unsteady torque measurements, the complete experimental setup needs to be dynamically characterised.","tags":null,"title":"Design, manufacturing and validation of a vertical-axis wind turbine setup for wind tunnel tests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Rik Decuyper","Philippe Dreesen","Joannes Schoukens","Mark Runacres","Koen Tiels"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"bfe2dd616b1eba67ed6cb7efabbb3136","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/b-6-f-60209-fd-4-d-48409-dc-300-fe-8-d-77-bced/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.031636Z","relpermalink":"/publication/b-6-f-60209-fd-4-d-48409-dc-300-fe-8-d-77-bced/","section":"publication","summary":"Multivariate polynomials are omnipresent in black-box modelling.

However, their practical application is stillfar from maturity, due to the lack of understanding of urban flows. High turbulence is one of the main characteristics of wind in complex environments, so special attention has been paid to modelling it inside wind tunnels for prototype testing. Previous experiments showed a considerable boost in VAWT performance when turbulence intensity increases, but the explanation of this increase still has to be determined.This study analyses the effect of turbulent flows on the performance of a NACA0018 airfoil, using a blade model provided with pressure tabs and a traverse system to analyze the wake. The model is subjected to the same angles of attack and Reynolds numbers that would be found in normal VAWT operation, while turbulence intensity and integral length scale are kept at levels similar to those found in urban environments.The effect of turbulence is evident as it considerably delays the stall angle ofthe blade. Using a Single Streamtube model, the results from this parametric study are compared with the overall turbine ratings, in order to find a way to optimize turbine blades using a simplified set-up.","tags":["Airfoils","Turbulence","Urban flows","VAWT"],"title":"Experimental Characterization of VAWT Airfoils Under Turbulent Flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Quentin Deltenre","Mark C.

Currently, there is no dedicated legal framework governing the installation on a building. Nevertheless, over the past years, our research group has received several demands from building owners wanting to install one or several turbines on their rooftop. The lack of a dedicated framework requires increased attention throughout the whole procedure. To prevent potentially harmful installations, we developed an approach to assess the feasibility of such initiatives. This paper reports a complete feasibility study to install a 3 kW wind turbine on the South Tower (the highest building in Belgium). The paper reviews the main steps from the concept towards the installation of a turbine on a high-rise rooftop. In overall terms, the installation of a 3 kW turbine on top of the South Tower has little impact on the building and its nearby environment. From an environmental perspective, the installation of a small building-mounted wind turbine on a rooftop can be meaningful. However, even in good wind conditions, the economic viability of the 3 kW turbine is low. This is mainly caused by the high study cost. Therefore, their global cost might still hold back potential investors.","tags":null,"title":"Installation of a Small Building-Mounted Wind Turbine: A Case Study from Idea to Implementation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

The proposed model structure is a polynomial nonlinear state-space model (PNLSS) which is an extension of the classical linear state-space modelwith nonlinear functions. In this work, we use experimental data of an aerofoil onto which a pitching motionis imposed, using a dedicated cyber-physical fluid dynamic (CPFD) setup. The pitch angle is consideredas the input to the system, while the aerodynamic force is considered as the output of the system.

One advantage is that installing a pair of counterrotating VAWTs on the same floating platform would result in thrust reduction and potential cancellation of the mooring yaw moment. In addition, such configurations could benefit from increased power output and reduced wake losses.In this article, we report on wind tunnel experiments to study the mechanical power output of a reference VAWT scale model, tested individually and in a closely-spaced pair of VAWTs. The power output of the individual VAWT configuration is compared with a pair of VAWTs spaced 1.3 diameters apart for two counterrotating directions. A net power increase in the power coefficient for the paired configuration of up to 17.0 % compared with two individual rotors has been observed.","tags":null,"title":"Wind tunnel experiments of a pair of interacting vertical-axis wind turbines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Rik Decuyper","Tim De Troyer","Mark Runacres","Koen Tiels","Joannes Schoukens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"e2d6abef98fcfa1a50401b0c2f1c87f0","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/f-8-c-1-ce-76-c-7504-ca-2-bb-84859-d-43325-aeb/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.035791Z","relpermalink":"/publication/f-8-c-1-ce-76-c-7504-ca-2-bb-84859-d-43325-aeb/","section":"publication","summary":"The flow-induced vibration of bluff bodies is an important problem of many marine, civil, or mechanical engineers.

For cases of complex terrain with significant changes in roughness due to vegetation or buildings, local winds can vary considerably across a wind farm site, resulting in inaccurate energy estimation. The site under investigation is on an island of complex terrain covered by 70% of thick forest and trees of roughly 15 to 20 m height. The atmospheric boundary layer stability is mainly neutral with a very unidirectional wind direction from ESE. Two meteorological masts have been installed providing measurements of more than a year. Average wind speeds over the NW direction and at 78 m height were measured to be 2.698 m/s for the first met mast and 2.545 m/s for the second met mast respectively. A wind resource assessment has been performed using 12 wind sectors and the commercial software MeteodynWT.

One transfer function captures all the aerodynamic forces that act on the structure during oscillation. A second transfer function translates these forces into an oscillatory motion, taking into account the structural parameters of the set up (mass, stiffness, damping). The third transfer function relates measurements from flow variables in the wake (velocity, pressure, vorticity) to the oscillation of the cylinder.We use imposed-oscillation CFD simulations to generate time series to construct the aero- dynamic transfer function. The imposed oscillation (a sinusoid, or a specific combination of sinusoids called a multisine) is used as the input signal, while the measured forces on the cylinder are the output signal.","tags":["Vortex-induced vibration","non-linear modelling"],"title":"A transfer function approach to model unsteady aerodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego Dominguez Fernandez","Marco Pröhl","Tim De Troyer","Markus Werner","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"7cf5ce988452182b42ec93c5f6401f04","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/0-b-8-c-276-b-95-c-54-c-2-c-8-e-29-b-0-a-4159724-eb/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.042401Z","relpermalink":"/publication/0-b-8-c-276-b-95-c-54-c-2-c-8-e-29-b-0-a-4159724-eb/","section":"publication","summary":"Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have experienced a renewed impulse during the last few years with important research efforts focused on them.

These are typically averaged and stored for every hour.In this paper we study the error in average energy production estimates when an inconsistent sample interval is used to store wind speed measurements. Based on wind speed measurements of one onshore and one offshore site and an independently-tested power curve, we estimate the mean power and show how it varies when the sample interval changes. We also illustrate how the power curve can be compensated for the inconsistent sample interval (of the wind speed measurement), by exploiting the correspondence between this effect and the effect of turbulence.We conclude that the error on the average energy production can be reduced and suggest how this can be realised in a practical wind resource assessment campaign.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of averaging time in wind speed measurements on energy production estimates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guoying Feng","Tim De Troyer","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393632000,"objectID":"f07be0612fd43f791f4c7c700ad64ad8","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/1-fe-42450587040-b-1960-f-0-f-197316-bdb-6/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.043733Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1-fe-42450587040-b-1960-f-0-f-197316-bdb-6/","section":"publication","summary":"Compared to horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs), vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) exhibit a different behaviour when built in tight arrays.

In this paper we develop special excitation signals that can be used both on the ground and in flight, in combination with novel measurement techniques to better correlate the GVT measurements with a numerical model.

In this way more information is obtained from the aircraft with a better accuracy. The test time of a GVT is due in part to the labour?intensive instrumentation of the aircraft. We therefore propose to use one or multiple scanning laser doppler vibrometers (sLDV) to build a preliminary model. The scanning laser can indeed be used in a first phase separation measurement step to quickly obtain a modal model with a pre?ordered spectral and spatial resolution. A more dedicated phase separation step can then be done in an optimized way: we already know from the first step where to install additional sensors, whether non?linear distortions are to be expected, and what frequency band is of interest. The proposed excitation signals and test strategies will be evaluated using numerical simulations and demonstrated on a small laboratory GVT set?up.","tags":["Modal analysis","Ground Vibration Test","Flutter test"],"title":"New excitation and measurement techniques to integrate GVT and flight flutter testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jochem Vermeir","Mark Runacres","Tim De Troyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1359676800,"objectID":"860203f51e8356075fb2e4e3fd3bd8e8","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/9-fb-40-d-1-c-2-fa-9486988-b-0580-c-197-da-529/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.045659Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9-fb-40-d-1-c-2-fa-9486988-b-0580-c-197-da-529/","section":"publication","summary":"1 Introduction In Flanders there are currently about 200 large windturbines (between 0.5 and 5 MW) installed. The number of small wind turbines (less than 100 kW) is roughly four times less, despite the much lower investment cost. It appears that the market of small wind turbines is deadlocked: small turbines still need technological improvement to close the performance gap with large wind turbines, but because there is no market, there is very little investment in research and development. Still, the public is supportive of wind turbines, and they think it important to invest in sustainable energy produc- tion (Van Hamme and Loix, 2011). In this paper we present the results of our feasibility study about small wind turbines in Flanders (Runacres et al., 2012). There are a number of small turbines on the market with adequate efficiency. Admittedly, many of the small wind turbines on the market are below par, but some are good enough to represent a viable alternative to other small-scale sources of renewable energy, such as photovoltaic panels. We have found that siting and resource assessment are an important impediment to the further development of small wind turbines. In particular, the classical methods for wind resource assessment are often not sufficient to obtain a reliable prediction of the annual energy production at a site suitable for small wind turbines (Willemsen and Wisse, 2002). The paper is organized as follows: we first present the general results of the feasibility study, focussing on the sensitivity of the approaches to predict annual yield. We then identify three key factors and propose alternatives that are scientifically more justified. 2 Feasibility study Are small wind turbines suitable to provide sustainable energy for SME's in Flanders? To answer this question, we performed wind speed measurements at various sites and conducted an exhaustive review of small wind turbines to compare the different characteristics. Combining these two aspects, we can make predictions of the annual energy production of different turbines at different sites. We performed wind measurements at 10.5 and 15 m, in built-up as well as rural areas. Our measurements were supplemented by measurements from the Royal Meteorological Institutes of Belgium (KMI) and the Netherlands (KNMI) and wind data available from project partners. For every site we constructed wind roses and energy diagrams and fitted different types of probability density functions to the data. Although these estimated distri- butions represent the data quite well (in terms of mean speed and overall shape), we found that energy yield predictions are very sensitive for the way in which the wind data are combined with the power curve. In our review of wind turbines, characteristics such as cut-in and cut- out speeds, rated power, the power curve, rotor diameter, and cost were collected for over 700 small wind turbines. To predict the annual yield at a certain site we only used turbines for which independently measured power curves were available. We also installed and tested two of our own small wind turbines. We found that rated power is a misleading indicator of the actual annual yield of a small wind turbine. To systematize the resource assessment we analysed a tool developed by Bruno Claessens and his collab- orators at Apère. This tool was used to predict the return on investment for different turbines at 18 locations in or close to Flanders, taking into account local wind speed, independently measured power curves, subsidies and fiscal policies. We extended the tool with our own measurements, added more wind turbines and improved the description of the atmospheric boundary layer. The tool is available for download from www.microwindturbine.be. The tool allows to use actual wind measurements as input data, or one can select a nearby measurement mast and a correction factor to take into account the surroundings (Wieringa, 1992). Often though the turbine will be installed at a height that differs from the height of the wind measurement. The wind speed then has to be extrapolated using the so-called log laws representing the atmospheric boundary layer. We compared different approaches using wind measurements at different heights and CFD simulations. Here again it turns out that the particular procedure used to correlate one wind speed to a different location can change the annual yield by a sig- nificant margin. To summarize, we have identified three key factors that determine the reliability of the resource assessment: * the detailed shape of the power curve at the wind speeds of interest, * the manner in which wind speed measurements are extrapolated from one height to another, * the method used to extract the distribution from the wind measurements. 3 Shape of the power curve We have performed resource assessment studies for ten different turbines using different sets of wind measurements and different density functions of the wind distribution. We found that rated power is a misleading indicator of the actual annual yield of a small wind turbine. The wind speed at limited heights (typically in the order of 15 m) and typical operating conditions of small wind turbines are invariably much lower than the rated speed. The cut-in speed and the steepness of the power curve at these low speeds will ultimately determine the annual energy production in a medium-to-low wind speeds area such as Flanders. This statement is illustrated by an example. The annual energy production of two different small wind turbines are compared for a specific site. Figure 1 shows the power curves of both turbines. A higher rated power and lower cut-in speed for turbine 1 can be determined from the figure. The wind data from a specific site is used to estimate the annual energy production. The results of the measurement campaign for a site in Flanders are shown. The figure shows the probabilty distribution of the measurements and the weibull distribution. As we now predict the annual energy production by the product of the probality distribution and the power curve, a higher energy production for turbine 2 is determined. The estimated annual energy production for turbine 1 is 2251 kWh/year and 2626 kWh/year for turbine 2. This implies also that what constitutes a 'most suited wind turbine' will be site dependent. In order to systematically compare different wind turbines for a given site one needs to compare the product of the wind distribution and the power curves. 4 Representation of the wind distribution In particular for the built environment and close to obstacles, the use of the Weibull distribution can give rise to substantial errors. Errors in ex- cess of 10% were found when e.g. a Weibull distribution was used, as is customary in most resource analyses. This is mainly due to its inability to cope with the non-zero probability of very low wind speeds. This inability skews the distribution at higher wind speeds and translates into an error of the estimated annual yield. We compare different methods to alleviate this problem (Carta et al., 2009) and we compare the effect on the accu- racy of the predicted annual yield. We also investigate the applicability of such distribution for wind speed measurements at the rooftop of buildings. More specifically we investigate the method by Takle and Brown (1977) that combines the Weibull distribution with a probability for null wind speeds, and the maximum entropy probability density function (Ram ??rez and Carta, 2006) that is specifically suited to match frequency histograms of the cube of the wind speed, and thus a useful tool to evaluate wind resources at a given site. Takle and Brown (1977) define a hybrid probability density function P H : PH(U) = F0?(U) + (1 ? F0)PW (U) (1) where * F0 is the probability of observing zero wind speeds, * ?(U) is the Dirac delta function, * P W (U ) is the classical Weibull distribution, * and U the wind speed. Ram ??rez and Carta (2006) rather define their probability density function as M PM(U,?1,...,?M)=exp ?0+?iUi (2) i?1 The ?'s are the distribution parameters, and ?0 in particular describes the non-null probability of the very small wind speeds. We show that we increase the accuracy of the annual yield production by using the maximum entropy distribution to represent the wind data. 5 Extrapolation of wind speeds at different heights Different approaches exist to represent the wind speed as a function of height above ground level. Often a logarithmic profile is assumed, such as (Manwell et al., 2009): with U(z)= ? ln z U the wind speed [m/s], U? the shear speed [m/s], (3) ? the von Karman constant (0.41), and U ? z + z0 z the height [m]. There are however different variations of these laws, and the differences between the different logarithmic approximations are substantial. In the paper we systematically compare different log-law approximations and their effect on resource assessment using CFD simulations. We demonstrate the results using annual yield predictions for a given site in Ranst, Flanders. In figure 3 a CFD simulation of the wind flow over the terrain is shown. To perform a numerical simulation of the site, a wind profile must be applied at the inlet boundary. This profile is shown in figure 4. 6 Conclusions In this paper we have discussed three key factors that greatly influence the accuracy of the annual yield prediction for small turbines: * the shape of the power curve at low to moderate wind speeds, * the choice of the probability density function to represent the wind distribution, * and the extrapolation of wind speeds to different heights. Based on our feasibility study for small wind turbines in Flanders, we used wind measurements, power curve measurements and CFD simulations to predict the energy production for different turbines at a given site. We find that the rated power is not a good predictor of annual energy yield in the typical conditions under which a small wind turbine operates in Flanders. We find that the standard use of the Weibull probability density function can lead to substantial errors. We were able to improve the accuracy of the yield prediction by tuning the probability density function and the height variation of the wind. References Carta, J., Ram ??rez, P., and Vel ?azquez, S.

This boundary layer can be con- structed in two ways: setting a logarithmic wind profile at the inlet boundary, or applying a wall function to the ground to resolve the wind profile above. These two boundary conditions are complementary and can be used together. The difficulty is that these two boundary conditions satisfy different equa- tions. The inlet profile is set by 2 parameters, the friction velocity U? and the roughness length z0. The wall function is also determined by 2 parameters, the roughness height Ks and the roughness constant Cs. They are related by the roughness length z0: as a rule of thumb, Ks = 20z0. The functions described above will be used to demonstrate how the two boundary conditions can be tuned for simultaneous use. This type of rough- ness implementation is currently available in the CFD code OpenFoam 2.0.x. The solver that we use for this paper is SimpleFoam. It is a steady-state solver for incompressible turbulent flow, using a semi implicit method for pressure- linked equations. The solver allows to couple the Navier-Stokes equations with an iterative procedure. The selected Reynolds Averaged Stress (RAS) turbulence model is the k-? model. This paper first deals with the imple- mentation of the atmospheric boundary layer on a flat terrain. The results are then applied to a siting study on an existing terrain. The study is finally validated with on-site measurements. 2 Simulation of the boundary layer The two ways of setting the boundary layer are first studied separately and then applied together, on a flat terrain. Using the wall function only, a uni- form inlet velocity will be turned into a logarithmic wind profile over the surface. The value for the (constant) flow velocity at the inlet is carefully chosen. It is exactly the mean wind velocity of the expected wind profile, so the flow remains constant over the surface. Results show that the error between the simulated profile and the expected profile is less than 5 %. Vari- ation of the roughness constant has a major influence on the error specially for lower heights. A constant value of 0.327 is chosen for Cs, which gives the best result. A second test consists of applying a logarithmic wind profile at the inlet and a slip boundary condition on the surface. The profile at the outlet of the case has exactly the expected profile. Combining both boundary conditions, it should be possible to set up a logarithmic wind profile that remains con- stant when moving over the surface (with wall function applied). If so, both boundary conditions are consistent and representative of the atmospheric boundary layer. A result for this simulation is shown in figure 1, where the wind profile at the outlet is compared with the expected profile (i.e. the profile at the inlet). 3 Siting study in complex terrain After studying both boundary conditions, we have applied them to a siting study on an existing terrain. In this case the complexity of the terrain is due to buildings. Terrain topography such as hills can be treated in the same way. We have measured the terrain with a total station and introduced it in the CFD code as a 3D surface. The first step in this study is to estimate the roughness length of the terrain. Tables with roughness lengths for each type of vegetation, height of and spatial area between buildings are present in the literature [2]. In the next step we have determined the parameters for implementing the boundary layer at the inlet of the case. These are determined by measuring the wind speed at 2 different heights (13 and 15 m) on the same location on the terrain by the use of 2 cup anemometers. The location of the mast should be chosen with care. If a certain wind direction is simulated, the mast should obviously be placed in front of the terrain and the flow should be nearly undisturbed. The measurement period is set to 1 to 2 days. We have chosen this period because an adequate estimate of the parameters has to be made. Therefore a sufficient amount of data should be gathered. Due to the variability of the wind speed and direction at these low heights, a few hours did not suffice to make a good estimate. The parameters can be calculated from these measurements by using the boundary layer equation. These parameters are then set to the inlet, in this way the correct boundary layer is implemented. In figure 2 the results of a simulation for the (dominant) South-West wind direction are shown. The variable that is plotted in the left part of the figure is the wind speed at a height of 15 m. A few interesting zones where the wind is accelerated (from 4 m/s at the inlet to 4,6 m/s) by the characteristics of the terrain can be seen. On the right hand-side of the figure the stream lines are plotted on a height of 15 m to show the turbulent regions above the terrain. 4 Validation The goal of these siting studies is to determine the best location to install a small-scale wind turbine. An important step in the study is the validation of the CFD simulations. The validation of these models is done by comparing the results of the simulations with field measurements. These consist of mea- suring the undisturbed wind velocity on 2 heights (to implement the correct boundary layers at the inlet as described above) and measuring the wind velocity on the terrain. We have chosen the location on the terrain using the results of the simulation. The mast is placed in a zone where the wind speed was accelerated and the turbulence was low. The measurements are then compared with the simulations. The error between the values of the wind speed is nearly 20%. This error may seem large for siting studies in com- plex terrain [3], but when comparing field measurements with wind tunnel experiments in an urban environment this error seems reasonable [4]. Also it should be kept in mind that the validation is done at a height of 15 m where effects such as turbulence and fluctuation of the wind direction on a small time scale will influence the error between the numerical and experimental set-up. This error will certainly have an effect on the estimation of the en- ergy production of a potential wind turbine. However we can conclude from the measurement that the wind does really accelerates in the zone where the mast is installed as was indicated by the simulations.

Most OMA estimators assume that the ambient forces are random noise sources with a flat amplitude spectrum. The transmissibility-based approach does not require this assumption: it works for almost any kind of ambient forces. The main advantage of the OMAX concept is the fact that it combines the advantages of Operational and Experimental Modal Analysis: ambient (unknown) forces as well as artificial (known) forces are processed simultaneously resulting in improved modal parameters. The main drawback of the existing OMAX estimators is related to the assumption that the ambient forces are white noise. In this paper, the transmissibility-based output-only approach will be combined with the input/output OMAX concept. This should result in a new methodology in the field of operational modal analysis allowing the estimation of (scaled) modal parameters in presence of arbitrary ambient (unknown) forces and artificial (known) forces. One important application is aeroelastic flutter. Flight flutter tests are necessary to assure that newly developed aircraft are free from flutter throughout the entire flight envelope. The airplane is excited by externally applied forces, but also due to turbulence. This turbulence excitation is not white at all, and can vary a lot between two flight phases. The transmissibility OMA approach benefits from changing operational loading conditions, and this enhances the accuracy of the estimated modal parameters. Our approach is tested on simulations and real-life measurements.","tags":["modal analysis","omax","transmissibility"],"title":"Combined use of FRFs and transmissibility functions in an OMAX framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tim De Troyer","Mark Runacres","Patrick Guillaume"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1264982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1264982400,"objectID":"5a0c418d388a89f75c01d05444659837","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/5-d-2-f-9-a-514-f-21460-d-9453-c-57-a-96-ca-1-ea-0/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.050709Z","relpermalink":"/publication/5-d-2-f-9-a-514-f-21460-d-9453-c-57-a-96-ca-1-ea-0/","section":"publication","summary":"Ambient noise is generally seen as an unwanted excitation that disturbs the estimation of vibration parameters. Av- eraging techniques are then used to decrease as much as possible the influence of the noise. However, this noise also excites the mechanical structure and thus increases the vibration response level. Moreover, it is possible that (broadband) noise excites vibration modes that are not well excited by the artificially applied forces. Those modes are missed by clas- sical estimation methods. Recently, classical EMA and OMA were combined into the so-called OMAX framework. In this framework both the artificial force and the ambient excitation are considered useful in determining the modal parameters. In this paper it is shown that the classical frequency-domain modal parameter estimators (rational fraction polynomial based and state space based) can be used without changing them, if the correct non-parametric preprocessing is applied to calculate the frequency response function (FRF) and the power spectrum (PSD). Special attention is paid to the case of structure-exciter interaction, where a direct OMAX approach would result in erroneous results. Also the importance of scaling the FRF and PSD is discussed. The approach is demonstrated on a typical OMAX case: flight flutter test of an airplane wing.","tags":["modal analysis","omax"],"title":"Frequency-domain modal analysis in the OMAX framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tim De Troyer","Kristel Deckers","Patrick Guillaume","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1241136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1241136000,"objectID":"103d3753b3096a79522f083e5cbe1695","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/e-4-ed-932-c-4-bdd-4-e-0-b-8-aea-6-d-581-d-516-e-73/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.051169Z","relpermalink":"/publication/e-4-ed-932-c-4-bdd-4-e-0-b-8-aea-6-d-581-d-516-e-73/","section":"publication","summary":"Classical Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) and Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) were recently combined into the so-called OMAX framework: Operational Modal Analysis with eXogenous inputs.

We searched for, but failed to find, the 3.3-day spectroscopic period of the binary in the radio data. This could be due to the absence of intrinsic synchrotron radiation in the colliding-wind region between the two components of the eclipsing binary,or due to the large amount of free-free absorption that blocks the synchrotron radiation. We are able to explain many of the observed characteristics of the radio data if the non-thermal emission is produced in a colliding-wind region between the supergiant and the combined winds of the binary. Furthermore, if the system is gravitationally bound, the orbital motion occurs over a period of ~20 years or longer, as suggested by the long-term variability in the radio data. We argue that the variability is due to the free-free absorption that changes with orbital phase or may also in part be due to changes in separation, should the orbit be eccentric.

These shocks are associated with an unstable, chaotic wind. The main improvement with respect to earlier models is the inclusion of the radial dependence of the shock velocity jump and compression ratio, based on one-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations. The decrease of the velocity jump and the compression ratio as a function of radius produces a rapidly decreasing synchrotron emissivity. This effectively prohibits the models from reproducing the spectral shape of the observed non-thermal radio emission. We investigate a number of escape routes by which the hydrodynamical predictions might be reconciled with the radio observations. We find that the observed spectral shape can be reproduced by a slower decline of the compression ratio and the velocity jump, by the re-acceleration of electrons in many shocks or by adopting a lower mass-loss rate. However, none of these escape routes are physically plausible. In particular, re-acceleration by feeding an electron distribution through a number of shocks, is in contradiction with current hydrodynamical simulations. These hydrodynamical simulations have their limitations, most notably the use of one-dimensionality. At present, it is not feasible to perform two-dimensional simulations of the wind out to the distances required for synchrotron-emission models. Based on the current hydrodynamic models, we suspect that the observed non-thermal radio emission from O stars cannot be explained by wind-embedded shocks associated with the instability of the line-driving mechanism. The most likely alternative mechanism is synchrotron emission from colliding winds. That would imply that all O stars with non-thermal radio emission should be members of binary or multiple systems.","tags":["hydrodynamics","instabilities","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal","stars: winds","outflows"],"title":"Can single O stars produce non-thermal radio emission?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean Paul Van Bendegem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"47ac181a42c55c2f502d5588849a9ee9","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/801323-da-5-f-1343-ff-9-df-1-d-3-d-2-b-6-c-4-e-051/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.053629Z","relpermalink":"/publication/801323-da-5-f-1343-ff-9-df-1-d-3-d-2-b-6-c-4-e-051/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Duurzame ontwikkeling en beslissen in grote onzekerheid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Frank Deconinck","Henri Eisendrath","Jean Paul Van Bendegem","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"1165a3d661308eace8dd0b3f9d621011","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/9032-b-0-a-7786-a-4-bfb-9-df-8-b-1379-be-3-dc-33/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.054605Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9032-b-0-a-7786-a-4-bfb-9-df-8-b-1379-be-3-dc-33/","section":"publication","summary":"Nuclear energy and sustainable development","tags":["nuclear"],"title":"Nuclear energy and sustainable development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henri Eisendrath","Jean Paul Van Bendegem","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"f8883e3c2afef01a7a5b892cab91f574","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/a-797-f-80-f-9-ecf-46-ff-9-ea-6736-d-340-c-3790/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.054072Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-797-f-80-f-9-ecf-46-ff-9-ea-6736-d-340-c-3790/","section":"publication","summary":"nuclear","tags":["nuclear"],"title":"Nuclear energy and sustainable development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sven Van Loo","Mark Runacres","Ronny Blomme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"9ad5b4a28e828069c6b22e7a4c161f64","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/2431-f-6101-f-2140-edaba-5-dc-9-fe-0-f-96-d-27/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.055071Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2431-f-6101-f-2140-edaba-5-dc-9-fe-0-f-96-d-27/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a model for the non-thermal radio emission from bright O stars, in terms of synchrotron emission from wind-embedded shocks.

We show that the width of these layers increases with increasing wavelength, which has important consequences for the shape of the spectrum. We also show that the strongest shocks produce the bulk of the emission, so that the emergent radio flux can be adequately described as coming from a small number of shocks, or even from a single shock. A single shock model is completely determined by four parameters: the position of the shock, the compression ratio and velocity jump of the shock, and the surface magnetic field. Applying a single shock model to the O5 If star Cyg OB2 No. 9 allows a good determination of the compression ratio and shock position and, to a lesser extent, the magnetic field and velocity jump.

This requires the problem to be formulated in a moving reference frame. The lack of Galilean invariance of the spherical equations of hydrodynamics is circumvented by recasting them in a pseudo-planar form. By applying the technique to a number of problems we show that it is fast and accurate, and has considerable conceptual advantages. It is particularly useful to test the dependence of solutions on the Galilean frame in which they were obtained.

We concentrate mainly on the multiple system HD 167971 (O5-8V + O5-8V + (O8I)). The soft part of the EPIC spectrum of this system is thermal with typical temperatures of about 2 × 106 to 9 × 106 K. The nature (thermal vs. non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrum is not unambiguously revealed by our data. If the emission is thermal, the high temperature of the plasma (~2.3 × 107 to 4.6 × 107 K) would be typical of what should be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long period binary system. This emission could arise from an interaction between the combined winds of the O5-8V + O5-8V close binary system and that of the more distant O8I companion. Assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum is non-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). Moreover, a marginal variability between our two XMM-Newton pointings could be attributed to an eclipse of the O5-8V + O5-8V system. The overall X-ray luminosity points to a significant X-ray luminosity excess of about a factor 4 possibly due to colliding winds. Considering HD 167971 along with several recent X-ray and radio observations, we propose that the simultaneous observation of non-thermal radiation in the X-ray (below 10.0 keV) and radio domains appears rather unlikely. Our investigation of our XMM-Newton data of NGC 6604 reveals a rather sparse distribution of X-ray emitters. Including the two bright non-thermal radio emitters HD 168112 and HD 167971, we present a list of 31 X-ray sources along with the results of the cross-correlation with optical and infrared catalogues.

Assuming HD 168112 to be a single star, our synchrotron model shows that the velocity jump of the shocks should be very high, or there should be a very large number of shocks in the wind.

The X-ray observations separated by five months reveal a decrease of the X-ray flux of ~30%. The radio emission on the other hand increases by a factor 5-7 between the two observations obtained roughly simultaneously with the XMM-Newton pointings.

Comparison with archive X-ray and radio data confirms the variability of this source in both wavelength ranges over a yet ill defined time scale.

The properties of bremsstrahlung, the dominant emission process at these wavelengths, make it sensitive to structure and allow us to study how the amount of structure changes in the wind by comparing the fluxes at different wavelengths. Possible forms of structure at these distances include Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs), stochastic clumping, a disk or a polar enhancement. As the CIRs are azimuthally asymmetric, they should result in variability at submillimetre or radio wavelengths. To look for this variability, we acquired 3.6 and 6 cm observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), covering about two rotational periods of the star. We supplemented these with archive observations from the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA), which cover a much longer time scale. We did not find variability at more than the +/-20% level. The long integration time does allow an accurate determination of the fluxes at 3.6 and 6 cm. Converting these fluxes into a mass loss rate, we find dot M = 3.5 x 10-6 Msun/yr. This value confirms the significant discrepancy with the mass loss rate derived from the Halpha profile, making zeta Pup an exception to the usually good agreement between the Halpha and radio mass loss rates. To study the run of structure as a function of distance, we supplemented the ATCA data by observing zeta Pup at 850 mu m with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and at 20 cm with the VLA. A smooth wind model shows that the millimetre fluxes are too high compared to the radio fluxes. While recombination of helium in the outer wind cannot be discounted as an explanation, the wealth of evidence for structure strongly suggests this as the explanation for the discrepancy. Model calculations show that the structure needs to be present in the inner ~ 70 R_* of the wind, but that it decays significantly, or maybe even disappears, beyond that radius.","tags":["stars: winds","outflows","radio continuum: stars"],"title":"Radio and submillimetre observations of wind structure in zeta Puppis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Runacres","Stanley Owocki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041379200,"objectID":"e6388f81c96ff8fe59b5723ee8f3e3fe","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/d-099-de-0-f-5-ee-84-bb-7-a-75293-b-02-c-357-b-0-b/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.059815Z","relpermalink":"/publication/d-099-de-0-f-5-ee-84-bb-7-a-75293-b-02-c-357-b-0-b/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a moving periodic box technique to study the outer-wind evolution of instability-generated structure in hot-star winds.

Our data include observations in the X-ray domain with XMM-Newton, in the radio domain with the VLA as well as optical spectroscopy. 9 Sgr is one of a few presumably single OB stars that display non-thermal radio emission. This phenomenon is attributed to synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons accelerated in strong hydrodynamic shocks in the stellar wind. Given the enormous supply of photospheric UV photons in the wind of 9 Sgr, inverse Compton scattering by these relativistic electrons is a priori expected to generate a non-thermal power law tail in the X-ray spectrum. Our EPIC and RGS spectra of 9 Sgr reveal a more complex situation than expected from this simple theoretical picture. While the bulk of the thermal X-ray emission from 9 Sgr arises most probably in a plasma at temperature ~ 3 x 106 K distributed throughout the wind, the nature of the hard emission in the X-ray spectrum is less clear. Assuming a non-thermal origin, our best fitting model yields a photon index of =2.9 for the power law component which would imply a low compression ratio of =2 x 107 K. Our VLA data indicate that the radio emission of 9 Sgr was clearly non-thermal at the time of the XMM-Newton observation. Again, we derive a low compression ratio (1.7) for the shocks that accelerate the electrons responsible for the synchrotron radio emission. Finally, our optical spectra reveal long-term radial velocity variations suggesting that 9 Sgr could be a long-period spectroscopic binary.

Our EPIC images of this region reveal a cluster of point sources, most of which have optical counterparts inside the very young open cluster NGC 6530.

One of the sources experienced a flare-like increase of its X-ray flux making it the second brightest source in M 8 after the O4 star 9 Sgr. The X-ray spectra of most of the brightest sources can be fitted with thermal plasma models with temperatures of kT ~ a few keV. Only a few of the X-ray selected PMS candidates are known to display Halpha emission and were previously classified as classical T Tauri stars. This suggests that most of the X-ray emitting PMS stars in NGC 6530 are weak-line T Tauri stars. In addition to 9 Sgr, our EPIC field of view contains also a few early-type stars. The X-ray emission from HD 164816 is found to be typical for an O9.5 III-IV star. At least one of the known Herbig Be stars in NGC 6530 (LkHalpha 115) exhibits a relatively strong X-ray emission, while most of the main sequence stars of spectral type B1 and later are not detected.

Variations in optical and ultraviolet line profiles reveal the presence of large-scale structure in the inner wind. The detection of X-rays and the existence of black troughs in saturated ultraviolet lines are indicative of small-scale structure. The geometric extent of both types of structure is poorly known. In principle, large-scale structure can be detected directly from very high spatial resolution observations that resolve the stellar wind. A simpler technique is to look for the presence of additional flux compared to that expected from a smooth wind. The run of this excess flux as a function of wavelength indicates how fast structure decays in the wind. If there is variability in the excess flux, it shows us that the structure must be large-scale. Such variability is suggested by two previous 6 cm radio observations of epsilon Ori: Abbott et al. (i̧teAbbott+al80) found 1.6 +/- 0.5 mJy, while Scuderi et al. (ţeScuderi+al98) measured only 0.60 +/- 0.06 mJy. This could indicate that the large-scale structure persists beyond ~ 50 R*. To further investigate this variability, we used the Very Large Array (VLA) to monitor epsilon Ori over a 5-day period in February 1999. We supplemented our data with observations from the VLA archive. In an attempt to resolve the stellar wind, we also obtained a series of high spatial resolution observations with the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) during January-March 1999. From this combined material we find no evidence for variability and we conclude that the Abbott et al. (cȩAbbott+al80) flux determination is in error. The data do show substantial excess flux at millimetre wavelengths, compared to a smooth wind. This excess is confirmed by a submillimetre observation which we obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The behaviour of epsilon Ori is therefore similar to what had been found previously for alpha Cam, delta Ori A, kappa Ori and zeta Pup. While the present data do not allow very strong constraints, they show that considerable structure must persist up to at least ~ 10 R* in the wind of epsilon Ori. The combined radio fluxes are used to derive a mass-loss rate of log dot M (Msun/yr)= -5.73 +/- 0.04. This value is in good agreement with the Halpha mass-loss rate. The good agreement between Halpha and radio mass-loss rates for hot stars in general remains puzzling, as it implies that the same amount of structure is present in very different formation regions.","tags":["stars: winds","outflows","Radio continuum: stars"],"title":"Radio and submillimetre observations of epsilon Ori","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronny Blomme","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1009843200,"objectID":"d2eff7447411ec168116e7c0c4f84ff8","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/697769407-e-5841-cd-952-b-14482-a-1408-c-5/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.064456Z","relpermalink":"/publication/697769407-e-5841-cd-952-b-14482-a-1408-c-5/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous work on IRAS observations showed inhomogen- eities (\"clumping\") to be present in the wind of some early- type stars.

The structure (i.e. inhomogeneities such as clumps and shocks) is generated by the instability of the line driving mechanism in the inner wind. It is self-excited in the sense that it persists even in the absence of explicit perturbations. The evolution of structure as it moves out with the flow is quantified by the radial dependence of statistical properties such as the clumping factor and the velocity dispersion. We find that structure evolves under the influence of two competing mechanisms. Dense clumps pressure-expand into the rarefied gas that separates them, but this expansion is counteracted by supersonic collisions among the clumps, which tend to compress them further. Because of such ongoing collisions, clumps can survive over an extended region out of pressure equilibrium with the rarefied surrounding gas. Moreover, the line-driving force has little rôle in maintaining the structure beyond about 20-30 R*, implying that the outer evolution can be simplified as a pure gasdynamical problem. In modelling the distant wind structure we find it is necessary to maintain a relatively fine constant grid spacing to resolve the often quite narrow dense clumps. We also find that variations in the heating and cooling, particularly the ``floor'' temperature to which shock-compressed gas is allowed to cool, can affect both the density and temperature variation. Finally, we find that increasing the value of the line-driving cut-off parameter kappamax can significantly enhance the level of flow structure. Overall, the results of our work suggest that structure initiated in the inner wind acceleration region can survive to substantial distances ( ~100 R*), and thus can have an important influence on observational diagnostics (e.g. infrared and radio emission) formed in the outer wind.","tags":["hydrodynamics","instabilities","stars: winds","outflows"],"title":"The outer evolution of instability-generated structure in radiatively driven stellar winds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronny Blomme","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1009843200,"objectID":"7e1471b5f14f75e2a2ca0f6f2ce5ae2b","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/ee-311-d-6-aa-0104922-a-106-b-54-f-78-fdfd-60/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.065997Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ee-311-d-6-aa-0104922-a-106-b-54-f-78-fdfd-60/","section":"publication","summary":"We apply the P32Tools model for the C100 detector to staring observations.

In this paper we investigate whether these shells can explain the long wavelength (=10 micron) continuum fluxes of O and early B stars. We had previously found that, for some stars, smooth wind models failed to explain the infrared and millimetre fluxes. To calculate the continuum flux, we model the clumping by a single shell. This single shell can represent the joint effect of a number of shells and we discuss how multiple shells can be combined into a single shell. The shell strength parameter is introduced, which combines density contrast and width of the shell. From the 12, 25 and 60 micron IRAS observations of zeta Pup, we derive a shell strength and position. We find that the clumping is less extreme than predicted by the hydrodynamical models. This means that the strength of the shells is less than the models predict, that there are not as many of them or that they do not fill a complete solid angle.

For four stars (alpha Cam, delta Ori A, kappa Ori and zeta Pup) the observations suggest the presence of an additional emission mechanism (inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic outflow).","tags":["Radiative transfer","stars: winds","outflows"],"title":"The infrared and radio continuum of early-type stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronny Blomme","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":757382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":757382400,"objectID":"f1eb4a9575064c679f62f6d85d373ee7","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/8154-eaeeee-1247-fa-934-de-94-aa-934-f-8-f-6/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.077177Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8154-eaeeee-1247-fa-934-de-94-aa-934-f-8-f-6/","section":"publication","summary":"not available","tags":["stars: winds","outflows"],"title":"Smooth winds and clumped winds for early-type stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronny Blomme","Mark Runacres"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":757382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":757382400,"objectID":"e4b81dd49c0a9ed95a284382d5a5cd63","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/f-2-f-3-f-95-a-4-b-1-c-4895-af-9-d-503-d-77-d-9-f-255/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.07344Z","relpermalink":"/publication/f-2-f-3-f-95-a-4-b-1-c-4895-af-9-d-503-d-77-d-9-f-255/","section":"publication","summary":"Not available","tags":["stars: winds","outflows"],"title":"Smooth winds and clumped winds for early-type stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Runacres","Ronny Blomme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":757382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":757382400,"objectID":"6e335c86614dad1972e58275ba52f596","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/598-e-6-f-54-a-0684-c-3-d-8834246-c-8-ebe-8-b-55/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.077852Z","relpermalink":"/publication/598-e-6-f-54-a-0684-c-3-d-8834246-c-8-ebe-8-b-55/","section":"publication","summary":"The contribution of bound-free and free-free processes to the outward acceleration of zeta Pup is studied and is found to be negligible.","tags":["hydrodynamics"],"title":"The importance of continuum radiation for the stellar wind hydrodynamics of hot stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Runacres","Ronny Blomme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":757382400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":757382400,"objectID":"ecb8094ec1e7a11b0228b8be8cc74b25","permalink":"https://mrunacre.github.io/publication/e-8-c-4370-f-28-a-14277-affdf-415-f-44-e-73-a-6/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T05:58:24.078493Z","relpermalink":"/publication/e-8-c-4370-f-28-a-14277-affdf-415-f-44-e-73-a-6/","section":"publication","summary":"The infrared and radio continuum fluxes of a number of OB-stars are compared to theoretical models.

We can observe this wind indirectly through its characteristic effects on the stellar spectrum. In particular, this mass flow influences the line profiles. These so called P-Cygni profiles can be observed in the visual part of the spectrum of early-type stars and Wolf-Rayet stars, as well as - and even more clearly - in the ultraviolet part. In order to study the stellar wind structure, a computer programme was written which calculates theoretical P-Cygni profiles using the Comoving Frame Method. As input, this code can use the results obtained from other programmes, such as a non-LTE code. Through parameter adjustments a fit to an observed profile can be made.","tags":["stars: winds","outflows"],"title":"Comoving-frame calculations for LAMBDA Cephei","type":"publication"}]
