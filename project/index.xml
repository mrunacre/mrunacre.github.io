      <title>High-fidelity surrogate wind data</title>
      <link>https://mrunacre.github.io/project/surrogate_data/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to create a modelling framework for
high-fidelity surrogate wind data. This work is largely the PhD project of
Daniele D&amp;rsquo;Ambrosio whom I supervise with prof.Â 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://flow.research.vub.be/en/tim-de-troyer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tim De Troyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing sophistication of wind turbine design and control generates a need for high-quality data. Therefore, the relatively limited set of measured wind data needs to be extended with computer-generated surrogate data, e.g. to make reliable statistical studies of energy production and mechanical loads. Surrogate data should realistically reflect the full scale of possible wind conditions. First, the surrogate data should conform to the same statistical descriptors as measured physical data (in particular the amplitude distribution and the frequency spectrum). There are methods that can handle this. A far bigger challenge is non-stationarity, reflected by the variation of wind conditions on distinct temporal scales (such as daily or seasonal variations). No existing method can fully capture this non-stationarity. Furthermore, wind data are three-dimensional, in the sense that information about the wind direction is as important as information about the wind speed.
In this application, we outline a unified mathematical framework to tackle the
twin challenges of non-stationarity and three- dimensionality. The framework
allows to generate non-stationary, three-dimensional wind time series with high
fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a framework is generic and can be used to generate surrogate data for other
non-stationary processes, such as ocean waves or pollutant dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preprint of a paper outline the approach is available through 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07218&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interaction of closely-spaced vertical-axis wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://mrunacre.github.io/project/vawt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vertical-axis wind turbines, when placed close together, have an improved power
production and very interesting aerodynamics. The experimental side of this
project is the PhD project of Antoine Vergaerde. The computational side of the
project is taken care of by Greeshma Boohalli Shivamallegowda.
Both Antoine and Greeshma are supervised by

&lt;a href=&#34;https://flow.research.vub.be/en/tim-de-troyer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tim De Troyer&lt;/a&gt; and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the viability of vertical-axis wind turbines for the production of
electricity is still open for debate, they may have certain niche applications,
and definitely have very interesting aerodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built our own set of scales models, shown above during a wind tunnel test run
at PoliMi in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Distributed wind energy</title>
      <link>https://mrunacre.github.io/project/distributed_wind/</link>

      <guid>https://mrunacre.github.io/project/distributed_wind/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working on distributed wind energy since 2007.
I was involved in IEA Wind Task 27 on Small wind turbines in strongly turbulent
environments and am currently involved in IEA Wind Task 41 on distributed wind.&lt;/p&gt;
