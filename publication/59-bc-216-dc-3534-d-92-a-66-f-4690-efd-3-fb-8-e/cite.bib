 abstract = {In building a reliable aeroelastic model of a newly developed aircraft, one key factor is the coherence between ground vibration and flight flutter tests. This complex relation entails the complementarity of the ground and flight tests, and the integration of the numerical model with experimental (ground and flight) data. Recent research projects have advanced the state of the art both for GVT and flight tests, but the clear headway of a thorough integration has been neglected. In this paper we develop special excitation signals that can be used both on the ground and in flight, in combination with novel measurement techniques to better correlate the GVT measurements with a numerical model. More specifically, we will design multisine signals that allow to detect and quantify the level of non-linear distortions and optimise the measurement time. In this way more information is obtained from the aircraft with a better accuracy. The test time of a GVT is due in part to the labour?intensive instrumentation of the aircraft. We therefore propose to use one or multiple scanning laser doppler vibrometers (sLDV) to build a preliminary model. The scanning laser can indeed be used in a first phase separation measurement step to quickly obtain a modal model with a pre?ordered spectral and spatial resolution. A more dedicated phase separation step can then be done in an optimized way: we already know from the first step where to install additional sensors, whether non?linear distortions are to be expected, and what frequency band is of interest. The proposed excitation signals and test strategies will be evaluated using numerical simulations and demonstrated on a small laboratory GVT set?up.},
