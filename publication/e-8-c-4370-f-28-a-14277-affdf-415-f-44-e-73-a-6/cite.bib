 abstract = {The infrared and radio continuum fluxes of a number of OB-stars are compared to theoretical models. This gives us information about the mass loss rates and the structure of the stellar wind. The more extreme O-star zeta Pup appears to show an effect of clumping in its continuum flux.},
