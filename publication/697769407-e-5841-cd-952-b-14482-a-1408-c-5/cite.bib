 abstract = {Previous work on IRAS observations showed inhomogen- eities ("clumping") to be present in the wind of some early- type stars. To study this in more detail, we obtained ISOPHOT data at 60, 90 and 160 m for 1 LBV, 2 B-type stars and 5 Wolf-Rayets. The ISOPHOT data consist of P32 oversampled maps, which show a strong and highly structured background (infrared cirrus) on which the weak signal of the star is super- posed. The data still need to be reduced and corrected for the background before fluxes can be derived.},
