 abstract = {In this work a black-box identification approach is used to identify a nonlinear model for nonlinear sys- tems exhibiting autonomous oscillations. We focus on the proces of vortex-induced vibrations where fluid- structure interactions cause vibrations. A polynomial nonlinear state space model structure is proposed and fitted to the data acquired from computational fluid dynamic simulations. Validation of the obtained model shows promising results with rms errors around 15%.},
