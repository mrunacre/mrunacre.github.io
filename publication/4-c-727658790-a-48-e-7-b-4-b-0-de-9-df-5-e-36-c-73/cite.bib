 abstract = {We present one-dimensional, time-dependent models of the clumps generated by the linedeshadowing instability. In order to follow the clumps out to distances of more than 1000 stellar radii, we use an efficient moving-box technique. We show that, within the approximations, the wind can remain clumped well into the formation region of the radio continuum.},
