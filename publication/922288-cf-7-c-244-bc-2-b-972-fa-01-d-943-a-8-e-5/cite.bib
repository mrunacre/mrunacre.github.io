 abstract = {Can small wind energy systems contribute to urban sustainable development in the Brussels Capital Region? To answer this question, we first performed wind measurements on potentially interesting sites selected based on their location, surrounding building heights and topographical information. Using these measurements we can estimate the annual energy production for a given turbine. Secondly, to have a more global idea about the wind potential in Brussels, a wind map is created using methods available in the literature. This wind map indicates regions with high and low wind potential.},
